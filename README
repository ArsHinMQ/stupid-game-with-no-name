# This Stupid Game That I Does Not Have a Name
So yeah basically in this game you have to move move all cannibals and normal people from one side of the road to the other, without every letting the cannobals outcome the normal people; otherwise, you lose. Simple as that.

This is a school project for me to get some easy extra grades.

Also all the charcater desing is done by my own self, I'm so proud of them I think they are so cute.
background, blood svg and cellebration svg where also downloaded/copied from some free sources.

### Why did I use Python & Flask
I'm planning on hosting this game on PythonEverywhere, so that's why I choose Flask. But the game base is just vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS.

### How to Run
```
python app.py
```
